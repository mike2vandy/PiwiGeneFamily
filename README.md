# PiwiGeneFamily

## These scripts were used in Vandewege et al. <year> Evolutionary history of the vertebrate Piwi gene family

All python scripts are written in python 2.7.

These scripts are functional, but are largely acting as documentation. There is little or no error control and may require modification for specific tasks.
